The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

\n&nbsp; \n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_info.jpg)\n\nSimple Discord RPC is a simple and easy to use mod that allows you to display what you are doing in Minecraft on your Discord Status. This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. \n\nThis mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs. Please refer to the WIKI above for more info\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_config.jpg)\n\nHate editing config files by hand? Why not try out the simple to use, [Config Editor App](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/) designed for Simple RPC. This app allows you to edit the config file step by step and even includes a Preview to show you what your Rich Presence will look like.\n\nThis app is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. You can download it from [HERE](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/)\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_help.jpg)\n\nYou can always refer to the [WIKI](https://srpc.fdd-docs.com) for help, but while I try to keep everything as simple as possible and keep the docs as useful as possible, sometimes things go wrong or it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nYou are more than welcome to open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_perms.jpg)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the description, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack. You are not allowed to Sell or rehost this mod elsewhere.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

the game boot faster by deferring non-essential initialization","body":"LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3547126,"followers":3661,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-06-16T23:27:59.452464Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6008873,"followers":6482,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa","XPsoVC5n","w4F7PG0f"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VlLxDisa","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.31 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Bump version, remove 1.20.2 as supported Minecraft version (comp500)\n- Merge pull request #295 from PepperCode1/pr/1.20.x/main/fix-model-offset (comp500)\n- Fix non-terrain model offset (PepperCode1)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-10T18:21:08.640568Z","downloads":174664,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fe6d0513ac332d890f1bd9bb9354a8e240b8f0e5","sha512":"27b4a73ca990742e27eee4348553c86c96c19fddcd0763892029f67ddbde42dc03c0ac21230403ae6b4ce4da315d0d49f582d3daab413b9ea84fd6d172ee7c4f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/VlLxDisa/indium-1.0.31%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.31+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":105350,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.31+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\logical_zoom-0.0.22.jar":{"sha512":"df953fecefa9217e296342a471edc993ff724af03b6316c9aa343c91a56f9aca93bb8f228ebf01fa2221ca6b57f8159757d49056794d457df70e5b1f1b2b3773","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8bOImuGU","slug":"logical-zoom","project_type":"mod","team":"olBNIdHo","title":"Logical Zoom","description":"A simple zoom key for Minecraft","body":"This is a simple Minecraft Fabic mod that adds a configurable zoom key.\n \nIt stacks it's zoom with the spyglass too for maximum zooooooom!\n \nIf you're a content creator, it would be super nice of you if you could mention the mod and point people to my channel here: https://youtube.com/logicalgeekboy\n\nBy default the C key is mapped for zooming (as with Optifine) but you can change this in the Controls settings of Minecraft.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2022-01-26T02:02:53.096382Z","updated":"2024-06-23T06:03:25.236738Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4047521,"followers":2765,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","22w11a","22w12a","1.19-pre3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre6","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["rvORsiwY","igj1EGYp","VdCygkuY","cTsJc9mK","iq9aafTJ","5tJdClkt","x4cswgvr","YK6hbErS","4DHV11l8","rLglVZBD","Og4Fk1Gg","vo1W0O1c","2w3yK8ef","AU8nwgOC","19voaoNq","OdzRH5hf","QaiqMN0D","L3JBkP55","POlskI3s","u3M5ROEs","WJg60WDZ","h7rIUxdF","3F0EV29D","x6zan49H","wI51X2ac","j6zaFIbZ","qGxqikLB","CEwUXkFY","zlCVtyS1","pOLLRXDQ","mljXTSw5","6UVt0xKb","lq1awVaR","XfchKMdL","ptpn9s7b","j5mWTLsV","7May6Ejt","hPQ5s52n","EGdnjG3x","uqLRu1PW","OL9wO7bF","nYzDnjGu","H7f9f2Hm","OyYm6CF5","d9gMEg0u","TaGhdtXR","APJvLWU9","9NpVaZxr","x8Pit8go","SKqP2pir","papGjlzO","QsuMVUdW","54GbAtvM","bOQr82Zm","9kpb92ws","j4OXiMqp","DwccS9tS","3B1xFsMB","tAME1Wi0","JNAjFCrB","XSgZG7Of","DN1z6Rl1","5mPRy5B6","XtpLGzEl","eb3qN1Fh","IpxKu0s8","wTmbgEgJ","VfJvxmE3","jRXrqPM7","VwBWDCzu","n9Zf0dPL","52RDBmQM","VxapEncs","8lkMJvNv","JPIC9ofE","QsPxlaAU","VWCXOQHF","HardtwjZ","ypX5P3jM","8XpXayfO","2OehSxqW","66q1EPRX","pMzvW79S","Tco32Bce","qZD3Vz9Z","4kzv6TQX","4YtziSu7","KBKeI45D","qzvSoyZZ","LLomGi3h","zNoUjaus","4OthHiGq","EhGfnoWY","aceDD6ip","Oh47k6kw","v95SmVXw","XwoPXFzL","fC3sNana","c3cpFF9t","CMYwvsPh","a4YzsmzU","kdNqcBQc","iBJRmSSb","ukr1WwVj","RMULKA7R","pAutSR2J","ZBGeGF7v","dSPko9qP","Ta6jwq1b","zIpRfJGw","wxqoWaxp","ETRrZyMz","T44uuxSa","nh5y85z7","CVHxjotn","Mm7KueIp","YeIziE6s","Q9VTlArC","yRJhlMwY","F7ZC75ln","4WOYtIge","4uGw2AoC","Jgnmccap","eqnLj0Ty","4DE0PgtE","qDWfufU7","lUY6MJko","y0I4mWUY","GJVl52mI","XcYyHBoY","AQ2U68wI","KGXpEmat","3RLtsfa8","44EA2Mfc","a8t3JGbs","ukn1ghoY","ASCvruGN","XgIVyuTx","FysgUMLL","l0EV3qFb","OnEUQPyg","ZrDXMT2l","DpEWP7FH","JRibkDsJ","diGHap5j","yDMz18wR","2z3GEBu5","9Em1LjD2","YrPJBVE6","tHwXqOG3","SMadIAU1","YqUYA4M8","HYMRNMcV","4LF51uza","7p3trw3A","59Fqhpg2","tcUfGg9x","UPenaMj3","Uya9vIxu","1Y3lxOX6","bK1a8KjO","OMNc4V5W","CjSVdAQR","ZXM48A5X","q5A2Cw7C","FSl57i99","7VZjYO7s","P5g3heP4","Z9uVc7X6","nnUuovth","iH5neQHO","9kZkB6eN","sBsNALne","2OrXvTpT","Xbz4ll09","xyMgzx36","WBLEReJT","7k32PYDx","aG9vZFHa","2zQ0rZri","eextCads","OK9i79fO","afcH17re","pwgniYj5","JXVDzP1d","XWSoEIYq","rCXSoyuo","CYT8LLOy","y75zt2Q0","gk3vF5vW","XsZ4b9CV","dgT81Q7W","9QYcSXx8","nu6lLhfO","CroB7LMQ","9nW7nT5B","vZ6VAHMU","gZQRrDJJ","clmSOM1p","tDUk08od","GhCAoeBk","1bZPXsmm","fFrpuPUR","VUb6WFfs","ajyiETwv","JwYwU8O2","CS4RfTDP","DVbS2kIx","r2xjfoD7","Agoi7AFd","MkzAXXDx","HemjHHpQ","aAcnoDHg","lnml1I18","e6fBwrPY","J87dYeyN","zkfGUaiV","3tzts2g9","gANduojd","x8Ir5T4F","PgeQ36xC","PrakWydh","6Ac6931r","rM5QKUL3","S4usf2jN","Arc3HTmh","OeSpIaIB","VnLAcknD","k30YZ0Zn","rVPyqDN2","YddGVt6V","9RdjaYYX","5mF9Ab6l","hr5gYdUa","DPuUdAbv","F3u2dEJG","BFUhkRCR","2udTpE8m","I7SvV3EL","yaOnJg8M","YnTygVlO","hC5AKKJz","qMoPCh9Z","o6exVMSl","6l1huD9q","KM8du29H","plgKIT6A","mKoCRI98","6RYOhhX3","TqwqW5dU","Vw0ikic1","T2VMc813","voFRojSn","NnvvKWlp","gSrsrmM1","36v1VCUb","6QKgVWs7","HFGqlRF0","zD4sJfuB","MwkhPYhf","A7CURPNe","NjD64J4h","vIbkWQvH","qvVrfelg","5hJWmW4r","SlF8LSPu","49aHHHOT","MbHYReOp","Hek1NTiF","ItQYro3P","jXc7eTKi","n97nAS3C","5a6694zO","LLAlgYfT","Gk2KxA6E","o42Lt8Ps","LGn4SuPQ","7Ew95Sjt","ZteQulNO","L1SXrTf0","YlyRB8o6","B633wDbe","A9d30Vws","pecEuozV","EHDdciG6","wzrdfTio","9I7jjOEm","meNVCVgn","Iqpdkpj4","aUpC497W","JvRwC1fO","VLe3jHDO","8czGsT2L"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/fa03aea7027f38b272a249d26cbe4cb7e94becf1.png"},"version":{"id":"A9d30Vws","project_id":"BVzZfTc1","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[ETF] Entity Texture Features 6.1","version_number":"6.1","changelog":"> -

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-06-13T21:09:50.372921Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":12892737,"followers":14261,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.4-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

command you commonly use? Tired of repeatedly typing it in over and over? Wouldn't it be easier to press a key on your keyboard to run the command?\n\n \n\nHow to add a macro:\n - Edit the config\n - Opening the config menu with Mod Menu.\n - Typing the following command : \"Cmdkeybinds showconfig\"\n - Using the keybind. Editable though the controls screen or the command macros config. By default it is unbound\n\n \n\nCommand Macros provides a quick and easy method of creating and running macros.\n\nCreating a macros is as easy as specifying the command, and the key to trigger the command.\n\nRestart not required! Editing/Creating a macro takes effect instantly, no need to relaunch.\n\nKeys are not limited to a single macro, multiple macros can be bound to the same key to have multiple commands run at once.\n\nDifferent Types of Macros:\n- Delayed Macro: Command has a configurable delay between key press and execution.\n\n- Repeating Macro: Command while auto repeat while holding down the key. Delay configurable\n\n- Toggled Repeating: Same as Repeating but the key press acts as a toggle, allowing the command to repeat without holding down the key\n\n- RunNTimes(New in 1.6.0!): Command will run N times when pressed. Delay between runs is configurable\n\n- Single use Macro: Command will only execute once per key press\n\n- Display only Macro: Chat screen will be opened and command will be typed in without being executed\n\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyrptonaught/CMDKeybinds/master/image.png\" width=\"1343\" height=\"711\" /></p>\n","published":"2022-12-12T08:19:50.922631Z","updated":"2024-03-11T01:12:55.913844Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":84030,"followers":233,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["K7PcKM4C","y3emEjYR","vtVujAR9","JKjtGbBt","NKaHbI7C","O02b8exL","snLr0hHP","FeUSjUHZ","918HsaTO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/h3r1moh7/976f4cf592fe67d22358aad9a5b75418fdcfbd01.png"},"version":{"id":"918HsaTO","project_id":"h3r1moh7","author_id":"dTrHFjYJ","featured":false,"name":"Command Macros 1.6.3-1.20.4","version_number":"1.6.3-1.20.4","changelog":"Port to 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T01:12:56.746076Z","downloads":6774,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"187a60152b330cc0164f91ce5bea93c84d2b32d5","sha512":"c1e34e2628e8138c905dfd7a49097007b0865aeb0201309f73c9c63f46a5d96fb8f6ffe10a1f0b972ff3f2fd7d53158ec07742c2f1a8cbc7367e373666733366"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/h3r1moh7/versions/918HsaTO/cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.4.jar","filename":"cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":425981,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"XGkCbZVw","user":{"id":"dTrHFjYJ","username":"kyrptonaught","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3196164?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-11-28T19:46:30.324533Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"cmdkeybind-1.6.3-1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\figura-0.1.4+1.20.4-fabric-mc.jar":{"sha512":"1eed8ec2d8897d4948d15d34f6f2714be35b0bc2574975b8dc0be93b9441f4190055035638942363ed53d55dd5980e337606a2820c2f69bed723452e46bb5a66","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"s9gIPDom","slug":"figura","project_type":"mod","team":"PwB8lscg","title":"Figura","description":"A client-side mod that allows for extensive customization of the player model.","body":"<h1 align=\"center\"> Figura </h1>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img alt=\"fabric\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/supported/fabric_vector.svg\">\n  <img alt=\"forge\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/supported/forge_vector.svg\">\n  <img alt=\"quilt\" height=\"56\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/supported/quilt_vector.svg\">\n</p>\n\n## A Minecraft Java client mod that allows you to extensively customize your player model and have other players see your Avatar without requiring any server mods!\n![blockbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiguraMC/Figura/HEAD/.github/assets/blockbench.png)\n\n## Utilizing the full potential of [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/).\n![animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiguraMC/Figura/HEAD/.github/assets/anims.png)\n\n![mesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiguraMC/Figura/HEAD/.github/assets/mesh_e.png)\n\n## Not only can you customize your model but Figura also has an optional [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) API to make your own scripts!\n\n![lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FiguraMC/Figura/HEAD/.github/assets/lua.png)\n\n## What if someone is invisible, or very small?

file called \"avatar.json\" (don't forget to check file extensions)\n> \n> This file can be completely empty, it just needs to be present for Figura to recognise it as an avatar\n\n### • How do I hide the vanilla model?\n> At the top of your script, put:\n>\n> • To hide literally everything (player, armor, elytra, held items):\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.ALL:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n>\n> • To hide only the player:\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.PLAYER:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n>\n> • To hide only armor:\n> ```lua\n> vanilla_model.ARMOR:setVisible(false)\n> ```\n> \n> • To hide other, or specific parts, you can check the in-game docs\n\n### • How do I play a Blockbench Animation?\n> Simply put this code in your script:\n> ```lua\n> animations.modelName.animationName:play()\n> ```\n> Where:\n> \n> \"`animations`\" is the global table which contains all animations\n> \n> \"`modelName`\" is the name of the model you are accessing the animation from\n> \n> \"`animationName`\" is, as the name says, the animation name\n\n### • What are Pings and how do I use them?\n> Pings are Lua functions that are executed for everyone running your avatar's script\n> \n> Pings are sent from the host player, and can be used to sync things like keypresses or action wheel actions\n> \n> To create a ping:\n> ```lua\n> function pings.myPing(arg1, arg2)\n>   -- code to run once the ping is called\n> end\n> ```\n> And to execute the ping, it's as simple as calling a lua function:\n> ```lua\n> pings.myPing(\"Hello\", \"World\")\n> ```\n> Note that pings are limited in their content and size, and are rate-limited\n\n### • How can I add an emissive texture?\n> Name the texture the same as the non-emissive counterpart, then add `_e` to the end\n> \n> And don't forget to set the places you don't want to glow to **transparent black** (#00000000), to also ensure compatibility with shader mods\n\n### • My emissives doesn't glow, nor have bloom with Iris/OptiFine shaders?\n> Since some shaders do not support emissives, a compatibility setting (default on) will change the render type of emissive textures to render them at it were fullbright, however that can lead to some unintended results\n>\n> You can force your avatar to use the correct emissive render type by using the render type `EYES` on your model\n\n### • How can I use Figura with OptiFine?\n> Figura will work with OptiFine but due to its closed source nature issues might arise, therefore we still recommend you try using Sodium+Iris (Fabric) or Rubidium+Oculus (Forge) instead\n> \n> Check out the full list of [alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/)\n\n### • Where can I find Avatars to download?\n> For now, you can find Avatars in the showcase channel in the official Discord server (A Web Based and In-Game browser is in the works!)\n\n### • My Minecraft is cracked (non-premium/non-original) or I'm trying to join a cracked offline mode server, why can't I use Figura?\n> Figura uses your account's UUID and your Mojang authentication as a way to prove you own that account, avoiding unwanted / malicious uploads\n> \n> Non-premium Minecraft accounts don't authenticate with Mojang, and Offline mode servers don't report working UUID's, as such can neither upload nor download Figura avatars\n\n\n## Community Resources\n\n* Want to learn / get into Lua scripting?\n  check out this [Lua quickstart](https://manuel-3.github.io/lua-quickstart) made by Manuel.\n\n* If you are tired of having to be in-game to look in the wiki, applejuice hosts the wiki as a [website.](https://applejuiceyy.github.io/figs/)\n\n* Are you new to Figura and are looking for a video tutorial about how everything works? You should probably watch Chloe's [Figura tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz7v2g2SFA8lOQUDS4z4-gIDLi_dWAhl) on YouTube.\n\n* Do you use VSCode and wish Figura's documentation autocompleted in the editor? GrandpaScout saves the day with their [VSDocs.](https://github.com/GrandpaScout/FiguraRewriteVSDocs/wiki)\n\n* Katt has created a Blockbench extention which adds a special model format for Figura! Read more [here.](https://github.com/KitCat962/figura-format-bbplugin) - Note. This plugin is available on the Blockbench plugin browser and should be installed from there.\n\n* By searching \"Figura\" in the VSCode extention browser you can install Manuel's Figura [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Manuel-Underscore.figura)! It adds multiple useful features including autocomplete for your model paths.","published":"2023-07-15T16:18:01.628049Z","updated":"2024-03-03T04:02:51.099417Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":95940,"followers":413,"categories":["decoration","social","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["4IW3S96F","8892Wqoi","dZE1NNlF","Bdf9vHIF","68pcF68H","H6QWSHtz","ialTavYW","pWWzQ2T1","DhHrk371","RKRxi6Ys","5qILjQQn","KlWfI83C","hk2saNqg","n07E8ats","DnT4RMN8","vo8jpIKn","OBMhxsH9","s1efSLTr","s8mttfVP","9YVrv5Mn","DVLIX9eq","m8a82uVo","ulEKyIjx","2Biyqps2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/s9gIPDom/9e3994b58a6a50d9143c0aa87df1c3b54e4b7919.png"},"version":{"id":"ialTavYW","project_id":"s9gIPDom","author_id":"nsPUMXYd","featured":true,"name":"Figura

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-06-14T09:11:55.894546Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3421746,"followers":2426,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv","yvWntDTo","4vJjL6YG","95DrIgKD","7qhkYutC","9BeU4JMZ","DOvpgsS7","3DUWVimm","GCiXd1DU","lfYHLBCj","HuiMDCpB","KneJBt8W","dVfrkFFQ","rfh88j45","bwjbN1G7","kakr6cxQ","IzAfhCj5","rGuR7oQZ","fMRe5pGZ","652AHAwn","2hVd4znq","bCmmruN5","F1JjnEjo","mWAFiRcK","wa38cdv3","SfWhB6Bd","7bxh2EoP","aFlca15F","up2Xg2sy","jVIxXxpT","dzyn3ag2","mtJzKD3q","ORJKgPNp","rD5uCHNg","khwkB6ra","BitxFUOE","K0xj45PZ","9xVJZ8Xr","xvYCCPha","cqKSqPQH","gpqniM0d","QWCOTizL","ch6lB4Mh","ZBKoFavY","nAaR07o2","JN7NY56L","at9xKHYT","9PuZ3Kv1","sZcSLicd","S7FrTSoe","nYfJt8sH","OUq3XNDY","5SZ2FbHC","BzcsKF0w","av84l2vE","9BVLcBub","jkLvxFFA","g2i5i750","FTmtYNdf","84vLaMxp","zQC8LMqE","vk0zN6fZ","jRyhNivy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/7a6acd528931a1a0d1b60fd0925b88227fb345cc.png"},"version":{"id":"FTmtYNdf","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 2.0.2","version_number":"2.0.2","changelog":"2.0.2\n- fixed the first person hand settings not getting reset correctly in 2.0.1\n- added the `is_swinging_right_arm` & `is_swinging_left_arm` boolean variables, \nused to distinguish right and left arm swinging in biped models, if no arm is swinging both should be false, if `swing_progress > 0` then one of these should be true.\n- added support for an optional `player_cape.jem` model file to be used for better animating the player cape\n`player_cape.jem` only contains a `cloak` part, positioned exactly as it is in the regular `player.jem`,\n  if this model is present it will render in a special way that will not apply the vanilla animations to the cape.\n  Allowing much easier custom animations\n  *(note this jem file can not be exported by the EMF config, but the `player.jem` exported model will work perfectly for it, as of v2.0.2)*\n\nThe only transforms EMF applies to `player_cape.jem` before rendering & custom animating is:\n- rotating the cape 180 degrees around the `y` axis.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-06-21T14:44:42.928177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7979690,"followers":9983,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"FawTQg29","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"uF4fzWRt","featured":false,"name":"v9.2.0

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2024-06-13T23:53:11.494853Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4423428,"followers":5176,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl","Fc7h8MWD","MfBeYvQa","84Zs6tNo","Ox1racg8","hI13Vg85","NksUpFjf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Ox1racg8","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T05:15:39.883269Z","downloads":126144,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1604e431b7ece673fff7b5d5c15ea0385ce9b33a","sha512":"e86ca6386b3be5f1d95845b85cada2341258bc7fe71f82ae7fd13bf4b7e889ec048ee7e564f0ab6de8a777e44026d9539866da677fe1c774ce87e2deedbd0292"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Ox1racg8/continuity-3.0.0-beta.5%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":1009401,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\placeholder-api-2.4.0-pre.1+1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"d80d44fef2a308edacb3ee048216459374af667792bcc69273ed4846245ca8cee2f656189a74d84255aa55889f381195be6acfcebe62500af14a5a128570ef44","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"eXts2L7r","slug":"placeholder-api","project_type":"mod","team":"tA4rMuIL","title":"Text Placeholder API","description":"Placeholder and Text manipulation library for your Minecraft mods.","body":"# About Placeholder API\n\nIt's a small, JIJ-able API that allows creation and parsing placeholders within strings and Minecraft Text Components.\nPlaceholder API uses a simple format of `%modid:type%` or `%modid:type data%` (`%modid:type/data%` prior to 1.19).\nIt also includes simple, general usage text format indented for simplifying user input in configs/chats/etc.\n\n## For users\n\nIt allows users to configure multiple mods in similar way without losing compatibility between mods.\nPlaceholders allow changing what and where any information is present within compatible mods.\n\nAdditionally, Simplified Text Format allows to style them in readable way without the requirement of writing JSON manually or using\ngenerators.\n- [Using placeholders](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/general)\n- [Default placeholder list](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/default-placeholders)\n- [Mod placeholder list](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/mod-placeholders)\n- [QuickText](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext)\n- [Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format)\n\nMods generally using this api should just include it directly, but you can downloaded updated version from here if needed!\n\n## For developers\n\nUsage of Placeholder API is a simple way to achieve good mod compatibility without having to implement\nmultiple mod specific apis.
